## 💡 Key Architectural Decisions

### Why Row-Level Isolation?
✅ **Scalability**: Linear scaling with tenant count
✅ **Simplicity**: Single database, no complex sharding
✅ **Cost**: No duplicate infrastructure per tenant
✅ **Flexibility**: Easy migration between tiers
✅ **Industry Standard**: Used by Stripe, Shopify, Salesforce

### Why Embedded companyId in JWT?
✅ **Performance**: No database lookup needed
✅ **Security**: Immutable during request lifetime
✅ **Validation**: Easy to verify in middleware
✅ **Traceability**: Available in all logs

### Why Soft Delete?
✅ **Compliance**: Maintain audit trail
✅ **Recovery**: Can restore deleted data
✅ **Reporting**: Historical data preserved
✅ **GDPR**: Easier data retention management

## 🔒 Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Protection
```
Layer 1: JWT Verification
  ↓
Layer 2: Company Existence Check
  ↓
Layer 3: Role/Permission Check
  ↓
Layer 4: Database Query Filter
  ↓
Layer 5: Ownership Verification
```

### Data Isolation Guarantees
1. Every document has `companyId`
2. Every query filters by `companyId`
3. Every index includes `companyId` prefix
4. JWT embeds `companyId` (tamper-proof)
5. Ownership verified before modifications

### Audit Trail
```
Every action tracked:
- WHO: User, email, role
- WHAT: Resource, action type
- WHEN: Timestamp
- WHERE: IP address, user agent
- WHY: Before/after data changes
```

- Company B users only see Company B data
- Can't see other company's students even with same database

✅ **Authorization**
- Counselor can't delete students
- Manager can manage counselors
- Admin can manage all resources of their company

✅ **Audit Trail**
- Every create/update/delete is logged
- Logs include who, what, when, before/after

✅ **Performance**
- Queries run in <100ms with correct indexes
- Can handle 1000+ concurrent requests

✅ **Security**
- No cross-tenant data leakage
- Token tampering detected
- Injection attacks prevented
